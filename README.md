## Libraries used
I use Python 3.9.13. The following are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

- numpy==1.21.5
- pandas==1.4.4
- matplotlib==3.5.2
- seaborn==0.11.2
- scikit-learn==1.0.2


## Data used
Stackoverflow Developer Survey data 2017
## Motivation for the project
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program. As I was working with the data in the course, I found myself expecially curious about the HomeRemote question in the dataset. As in the course, we already saw it correlated with Job Satisfaction, I was curious in finding out new/other insights. 
I will start a new remote job myself in a month from now and very excited to answer the below questions with the before Corona information of 2017. 

1) In 2017 was the country an important factor for the possibility to work from home?
2) Is Employment Status an indicator for a remote job?
3) Which formal education allows most workers to have a remote job?
4) Do smaller companies offer working remotely more often?
5) What are the determining factors in predicting if working from home is possible?
